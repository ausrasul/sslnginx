# SSL Nginx
A Docker-based solution that automates the process of setting up an Nginx server with SSL certificates.

With a single command, it uses Let's Encrypts Certbot inside a docker container to create or renew SSL certificates and load them into Nginx.

This project simplifies the transition from HTTP to HTTPS.

Nothing other than Docker need to be installed.
